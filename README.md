# Quiz 8 Design Research
## Part 1. Imaging Technique Inspiration
### Our chosen artwork: Piet Mondrian 'Broadway Boogie Woogie'
I find inspiration from the 9 Squares Project, a collaborative motion design experiment where artists animate abstract geometric compositions within a 3×3 grid.
The project uses squares, lines, and color rhythm to create playful yet structured motion.
I find this technique interesting and suitable for our project because it visualizes order and rhythm through geometric animation.
It helps inspiring how we can translate static grid into dynamic motion, balancing simplicity, variation, and visual energy.

## Part 2: Coding Technique Exploration
**Technique:** p5.js tile-grid animation using nested loops, `rect()`, `translate()`, and time functions (`frameCount`, `sin()`/`noise`) with `push()/pop()` for per-tile transforms.  
I find this technique suitable because it lets me animate square modules inside a 3×3 grid (à la “9 Squares”), creating rhythm and variation while keeping strong structure—perfect for turning Mondrian-style layouts into living motion.
