# Quiz 8 Design Research
## Part 1. Imaging Technique Inspiration
### Our chosen artwork: Piet Mondrian 'Broadway Boogie Woogie'
I find inspiration from the 9 Squares Project, a collaborative motion design experiment where artists animate abstract geometric compositions within a 3×3 grid.
The project uses squares, lines, and color rhythm to create playful yet structured motion.
I find this technique interesting and suitable for our project because it visualizes order and rhythm through geometric animation.
It helps inspiring how we can translate static grid into dynamic motion, balancing simplicity, variation, and visual energy.

## Part 2: Coding Technique Exploration
**Technique:** p5.js animated squares using transformation and timing functions.  
This technique combines `rect()`, `translate()`, and `rotate()` with `frameCount` and `sin()` to create rhythmic motion such as scaling, rotation, or color changes of squares.  
I find this method suitable for my project because it helps simulate the dynamic energy of the “9 Squares” animation—translating Mondrian’s geometric simplicity into playful, moving forms without strict grids.
